Terminology, general knowledge
---
- This is a very important subject.
- This is kind of how rust represents null values
- You should spend time understanding this subject, but don't get stuck, on it. Leave it be if you don't get why it exists, and revisit it later
- There is nothing inherently special about `Option<T>`, it's just a very widely used and agreed upon data structure
